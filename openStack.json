The Siaras offering, cloudScape, allows network Service Providers to federate a variety of dissimilar \u201cunderclouds\u201d such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and IBM SoftLayer, along with their own cloud and network assets. The result is a seamless yet diverse cloud experience for enterprise IT coupled with on-demand app-specific intercloud WANs.", "", "With the major Cloud trend, Service Providers are now connecting Enterprise to Amazon Web Services. Per Information week article, accessing Amazon Web Services servers over AT&T NetBond new service, bypasses the public Internet, increasing the security of the connection. The approach can also lower network latency by 50%.", "", "Siaras provides a platform that enables Service Providers to offer integrated multi-cloud and multi-site WAN services. Two well-known global service providers are beta trial customers now. While cloud-based services are typically offered on a per-hour or per-day contract with fully automated set-up, configuration and billing for new customer deployments, WAN services today are typically offered on a multi-year contract with manually set-up, configuration and billing. Siaras enables fully-automated deployment of BOTH cloud and WAN services, with day-to-day or month-to-month contracts, based on enterprise customer policies such as cost, geography, security, SLA, etc. These services can be offered whether the cloud is operated by the service provider or by third-party cloud providers such as AWS. The Siaras OpenStack platform enables TEaaS (Traffic Engineering as a Service) as well as WaaS (WAN as a Service) designed to complement IaaS cloud services.", "", "Siaras CEO Vivek Ragavan and Siaras management team would be please to meet with you and introduce you the revolutionary new software platform that promises to alter the way enterprises view their cloud and network providers on week of Monday the 3rd to the 7th of November at : www.openstack.org/summit @Palais des congr\u00e8s Porte Maillot Paris."], "image_url": ["//static.sched.org/a4/1417666/avatar.jpg.75x75px.jpg"], "name": ["Tournesac"], "links": ["http://www.siaras.com"], "title_company_location": ["Advisor,         Siaras", "Paris"]},

{"about": ["Mark is currently a Technical Leader in Cisco's Cloud and Virtualization Group, but generally prefers to think of himself as a breadth-first technologist.  He currently hacks on OpenStack and deployment/operations tools for OpenStack as part of his job and after hours too.  In past lives he has worked as a software engineer and engineering manager designing web applications, automation systems, mobile apps, traffic generators, distributed systems, and more weasely hacks than he can shake a stick at.  He also helps design and support the infrastructure running the software he develops, including award-winning SANs, LANs, load balancing, monitoring, hypervisors, and servers.  Mark works on massively scalable data center architecture, Big Data, cloud computing, software defined networking, and distributed systems with a heavy emphasis on OpenStack.  A developer by trade, Mark has been enamoured of Open Source since approximately his first exposure to the Internet.  He founded Cisco's Open Source Conference and leads the wing of the OpenStack@Cisco team that focuses on deployment enablement and system architecture.  In 2013, Mark founded the Triangle OpenStack Meetup and grew it's membership to 450+ members in the first 18 months of it's existence.  He has a two-digit OpenStack Foundation membership profile number and a large enough collection of OpenStack Summit t-shirts that he rarely has to do laundry.  Mark apparently has a penchant for programming languages starting with \"P\" and has prospered for parts of the past decade penning primarily Python, Perl, and Puppet.  He has a habit of including vacation photos and Douglas Adams quotes in his presentations and his time can generally be bought with a sufficient quantity of doughnuts.  When not holed up within the trail-photo covered walls of his workspace at Cisco's Research Triangle Park campus, Mark can be found hiking, camping, backpacking, or making sawdust with extreme prejudice.  Mark is a proud alumni of the Park Scholarships at North Carolina State University, where he currently serves as a Regional Selection Committee Leader.
