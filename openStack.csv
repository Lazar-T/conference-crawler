I had this green 10 speed we got at Sear's right before we went over there. I felt like I could fly all over that town. After high school in Stockton I joined the Air Force and spent 4 years as an Airman.,,First I was stationed an hour and a half from home at Beale AFB. I spent eighteen months in Korea at Osan Air Base. Korea - what can I say?  I did more there in 1 year than my whole life before.  I was able to take time off to see the 88 Olympics and make a few trips to Okinawa and Hawaii before having to finish my four years at Wurtsmith AFB in Michigan.,,When I got out of the Air Force in 1989 I took some snow with me to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina to hang out with my buds from Korea; Shayne, Joe, and Kenny. It was the coldest winter in 43 years! Then it was a three month tour of South America to see my father's parents on the farm near Coihueco and my Tio Alex near Rio. New Year's was spent at Kenny's in Buenos Aires. Ken's mom, Bunny, was pretty cool and they had an armored car for his dad. We saw the widest waterfall in the world - Foz do Iguaçu, crossed the Gran Chaco desert by bus, Partied at Carnival in Bolivia, visited a grass island in the middle of the highest fresh water Lake Titicaca. A year with Mom in Atlanta (Hi Sean Kelly) and then back to sunny California where I met my beautiful wife, Nadia, and started my family.  We have 5 great kids and get along just fine.,,I've always been interested in technology and making complex systems work well and attainable to ""normal"" people. My home stereo system is a good example of this. I've always had hundreds of different kinds of interconnect cables to make everything work well together.

"Daniel Farrell is Red Hat's Software Defined Networking Intern. He entered industry as SDN started picking up speed and his work has focused on that domain ever since. Farrell helped build OpenFlow support into switches during his first internship with Extreme Networks. Many of his cycles went into extending OFTest and building the team's automated regression testbed. During a second internship and subsequent Co-Op at Extreme, he followed SDN's progression and transitioned to OpenStack Neutron work. Since Farrell began working at Red Hat, he has touched many aspects of OpenDaylight, but his main focus is on building substantial performance tests for the Helium release -- a major objective for the Integration team. To this end he developed a robust, highly automated and cleanly coded performance test with CBench at its core. Development continues at a rapid pace, so find him at the conference or ping him on IRC for the latest (username dfarrell07 most everywhere).",,Daniel Farrell,"Intern,         Red Hat,Raleigh, NC",,http://dfarrell.me

"Federico is the area head of Smart Infrastructures Area at CREATE-NET, an ICT research center located in Trentino. Federico coordinates the research activities of the area around deployment, management and operation of Future Internet infrastructures and platforms based on Cloud Computing and  Software-defined Network paradigms. Federico's current research activities focus on:,,Highly available and automated cloud environments. Cloud paradigm is becoming more and more central in the ICT arena as solution to simplify the management of ICT resources and services. As such it is a fundamental building block of Future Internet research. My research explores architectures and tools to automate deployment of cloud environments from the IaaS layer to the PaaS layer ensuring high availability of the services (i.e. no single point of failure) and exploring different combination of vertical and horizontal elasticity (i.e. supporting flexible service load). Our research activities in the field goes from traditional clouds, where computational capacities are hosted in data-centers, to edge clouds, where computational capacities are deployed closer to the users.,,Software-defined networks for cloud and data centers. To ensure QoS of cloud-based applications, it is not enough to manage SLAs related to computational and storage. Scaling computational and storage virtual resources used by applications can only ensure given performances inside the virtual appliance. When applications get more and more complex and distributed, ensuring QoS requires controlling the connectivity among the them to shape the traffic accordingly. Our research on this topic, focuses on providing NaaS through Software-defined Network technologies in connection with cloud environments and data centers. The research starts from state-of-the-art solution for adoption of Software-defined Network technologies in data-centers and moves towards definition of paradigms and solutions for Application-defined Networking, where applications - accordingly to their needs - ""negotiate"" network services.,,Green and Zero CO. Data centers are one of the most energy consuming infrastructures in the world. They are estimated to use more than 1.5% of total produced energy. Our research focus on improving the efficiency of the amount of energy used to run servers and the facilities where they are hosted. Our research activities start from virtual appliance consolidation inside a data center to reduce the number of active servers and its moving toward novel challenges where service load are shaped and virtual machine consolidated to take most possible advantage of renewable energies so as to minimize data center CO2 emissions.,,My research team adopts (and contributes to) different Open Source technologies, such as OpenStack, CloudFoundry, OpenFlow, Ryu, Apache Hadoop.",https://graph.facebook.com/1221501409/picture?type=normal,Federico Michele Facca,"Area Head,         CREATE-NET,Trento, Italy",,"http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1221501409,http://www.flickr.com/photos/chicco/"

"Siaras,www.siaras.com, a new company in the hot cloud space, is due to launch November 3 at the OpenStack Summit in Paris. Founded by Vivek Ragavan and Sig Luft, both part of the founding team at what is still the sixth largest acquisition ever of a venture-backed startup, Siaras has develop a revolutionary new software platform that promises to alter the way enterprises view their cloud and network providers. The Siaras offering, cloudScape, allows network Service Providers to federate a variety of dissimilar “underclouds” such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and IBM SoftLayer, along with their own cloud and network assets. The result is a seamless yet diverse cloud experience for enterprise IT coupled with on-demand app-specific intercloud WANs.,,With the major Cloud trend, Service Providers are now connecting Enterprise to Amazon Web Services. Per Information week article, accessing Amazon Web Services servers over AT&T NetBond new service, bypasses the public Internet, increasing the security of the connection. The approach can also lower network latency by 50%.,,Siaras provides a platform that enables Service Providers to offer integrated multi-cloud and multi-site WAN services. Two well-known global service providers are beta trial customers now. While cloud-based services are typically offered on a per-hour or per-day contract with fully automated set-up, configuration and billing for new customer deployments, WAN services today are typically offered on a multi-year contract with manually set-up, configuration and billing. Siaras enables fully-automated deployment of BOTH cloud and WAN services, with day-to-day or month-to-month contracts, based on enterprise customer policies such as cost, geography, security, SLA, etc. These services can be offered whether the cloud is operated by the service provider or by third-party cloud providers such as AWS. The Siaras OpenStack platform enables TEaaS (Traffic Engineering as a Service) as well as WaaS (WAN as a Service) designed to complement IaaS cloud services.,,Siaras CEO Vivek Ragavan and Siaras management team would be please to meet with you and introduce you the revolutionary new software platform that promises to alter the way enterprises view their cloud and network providers on week of Monday the 3rd to the 7th of November at : www.openstack.org/summit @Palais des congrès Porte Maillot Paris.",//static.sched.org/a4/1417666/avatar.jpg.75x75px.jpg,Tournesac,"Advisor,         Siaras,Paris",,http://www.siaras.com

"Mark is currently a Technical Leader in Cisco's Cloud and Virtualization Group, but generally prefers to think of himself as a breadth-first technologist.  He currently hacks on OpenStack and deployment/operations tools for OpenStack as part of his job and after hours too.  In past lives he has worked as a software engineer and engineering manager designing web applications, automation systems, mobile apps, traffic generators, distributed systems, and more weasely hacks than he can shake a stick at.  He also helps design and support the infrastructure running the software he develops, including award-winning SANs, LANs, load balancing, monitoring, hypervisors, and servers.  Mark works on massively scalable data center architecture, Big Data, cloud computing, software defined networking, and distributed systems with a heavy emphasis on OpenStack.  A developer by trade, Mark has been enamoured of Open Source since approximately his first exposure to the Internet.  He founded Cisco's Open Source Conference and leads the wing of the OpenStack@Cisco team that focuses on deployment enablement and system architecture.  In 2013, Mark founded the Triangle OpenStack Meetup and grew it's membership to 450+ members in the first 18 months of it's existence.  He has a two-digit OpenStack Foundation membership profile number and a large enough collection of OpenStack Summit t-shirts that he rarely has to do laundry.  Mark apparently has a penchant for programming languages starting with ""P"" and has prospered for parts of the past decade penning primarily Python, Perl, and Puppet.  He has a habit of including vacation photos and Douglas Adams quotes in his presentations and his time can generally be bought with a sufficient quantity of doughnuts.  When not holed up within the trail-photo covered walls of his workspace at Cisco's Research Triangle Park campus, Mark can be found hiking, camping, backpacking, or making sawdust with extreme prejudice.  Mark is a proud alumni of the Park Scholarships at North Carolina State University, where he currently serves as a Regional Selection Committee Leader.
